# Predicting-Iowa-House-Prices
This project predicted house prices in Ames, Iowa with 79 features (2006-2010). The training set had 1460 observations and the test set had 1459 observations.
## Updates
* Engineered features for tree algorithms and linear regression separately. Used label-encoders for trees and one-hot encoders for linear regression with regularization; checked whether missing values are missing at random
* Built pipelines with PCA and cross-validation, and tested models on the out-of-sample data
